    <h2>Hi, I'm Osy</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>Front-end web developer</strong> with over a decade of experience in translating design concepts into
      visually stunning web interfaces. Proficient in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong
        >JavaScript</strong
      >, I focus on creating responsive websites that enhance user experiences and drive conversion.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I've been hand-coding websites since I was 12 years old, back in the days when Notepad was our "IDE" of choice,
      since Dreamweaver was more of a hindrance then help.
    </p>

    <p>
      It all started as a hobby for the love of creating something new and interactive, as a kid that meant fun fan
      sites for the video games I was <del>obsessed with</del> loved. (Legend of Dragoon anyone?) Eventually, I had the
      opportunity to work with commercial clients when I was 15, earning volunteer hours through my teacher's freelance
      agency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating websites customers love is my passion. Whether it's architecting technical solutions, streamlining
      processes, boosting conversion rates, or optimizing user experiences, each challenge is a unique puzzle.
    </p>

    <p>Even the most complex problems are just fun waiting to be solved.</p>
