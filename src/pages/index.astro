    <h2>Osy</h2>
  <p>
    Front-end web developer with over a decade of experience in translating design concepts into seamless,
    user-friendly web interfaces. Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my focus is on creating visually appealing and
    responsive websites that enhance user experience.
  </p>


    <h3>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I've been hand-coding websites since I was 12 years old, back in the days when Notepad was our "IDE" of choice,
      since Dreamweaver was more of a hindrance then help.
    </p>

    <p>
      It all started as a hobby for the love of creating something new and interactive, as a kid that meant fun fan
      sites for the video games I was <del>obsessed with</del> loved. (Legend of Dragoon anyone?) Eventually, I had the
      opportunity to work with commercial clients when I was 15, earning volunteer hours through my teacher's freelance
      agency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating websites that customers love was even more rewarding, partly because of all the intricacies that come
      with working for external clients, and mostly for the external validation of doing something not everyone can do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Architecting technical solutions to everyday problems, streamlining business processes, increasing customer
      conversion rate, optimizing the user experienceâ€¦all interesting challenges, with their own unique solutions, it's
      impossible to get bored.
    </p>

    <p>Even the most complex problems are just fun puzzles in disguise, waiting to be solved.</p>
