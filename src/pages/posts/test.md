Welcome to my _blog_.

## Messing around

Lets see how markdown looks in the front.

### Styling Text

1. **Testing** some markdown
2. _Testing_ more markdown

### Unordered list

- Item II
- Item III

### Code Block

```css
/* A code block */
.class {
  color: #ff0000;
}
```

## Result

It doesn't seem to like comma's and elipses...
