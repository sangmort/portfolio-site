    <h3>Steel Tabs - New Tab Browser Extension</h3>
    <p>
      A fun project that transforms the new tab experience in Chromium Browsers and Firefox. Replaces the default "new
      tab" content with a beautifully styled, Steelers-themed, page that generates random "Tomlinisms." Essentially a
      "motivational qoute" for sports fans.

    <h3>Multi Discord Avatar Previewer</h3>
    <p>
      Sick of uploading images one-at a time to discord to see how your avatar would look? I was too, so I made this
      little tool. Allows you to upload and compare multiple images as avatars, in both light & dark theme, all at once.
