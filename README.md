## Development Notes

### Performance Improvements
- Limit number of stars and clouds generated by screensize/viewport
- Refactor to use SVG circles instead of Div elements for each star
- Refactor to use a single SVG with multiple circle paths inside of it for each star
- Reduce .ico size and fix web manifest URL causing redirects
- Add `will-change: filter;` on rules that use `filter` keyframes animations for performance.

### Fixed Bugs/Issues
Parallax effecting layout
	- The JS that applied a transform to the for parallax effect on desktop was applying it to mobile header as well, causing layout conflicts with flex on smaller screens.
	- **Fix** Refactor JS to check if viewport is >=1400px (desktop) before applying transform to header

Clouds were not appearing on mobile devices
	- Keyframe animations were below `@media` queries, thus not triggering on mobile screens. 
	- **Fix** Refactor CSS so `@keyframes` were above `@media` queries in the CSS cascade.

Parallax scroll effect not smooth, had a tacky feeling
	- When user would scroll down page, scrolling was not smooth and would feel as if the mouse would "stick"
    - **Fix** Refactor JS to optimize rendering / animations by using translate3d(), allows browser to use Hardware Acceleration / GNU instead of just CPU for better performance. Also increased scroll speed of the parallax paths for a more fluid UX.

### Known Bugs/Issues
- [ ] Mobile Navigation Close Button
	- When user clicks outside of navigation pane to close navigation, the close button remains a X instead of reverting to a hamburger
- [x] Vertical Tabs initial focus
	- The first tab is open by default, but it is not active or focused so the CSS effect is not present
- [x] Parallax effect jankiness
	- When scrolling down, page seems to "stick" a little 
- [ ] Logo has a:link border-bottom effect on hover

### To-Do
- [ ] Back to Top floating button
	- Better UX & efficiency to get back to the top:
		- On desktop, as there is no "home" link in the navigation
		- On mobile, as "home" in navigation link reloads the entire page
- [x] Remove double arrow from headings
- [ ] Contact Form
	- Better UX then clicking a `mailto:` link
	- Allows email validation and rate limiting can be employed
